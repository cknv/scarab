Scarab
======

A small library of tools you might find handy when building a static site engine.

Installation
------------

Currently scarab is not distributed. So in order to get your hands on it, you will have to git clone it, and then pip install it:

.. code:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/cknv/scarab
    cd scarab
    pip install -e .

When I am more happy with the state of scarab, it will be published properly.
